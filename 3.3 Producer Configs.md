# 3.3 Producer Configs

### buffer.memory
The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will block for max.block.ms after which it will throw an exception.

This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression (if compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests.

Type:	long
Default:	33554432
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	high

### retries
Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by delivery.timeout.ms expires first before successful acknowledgement. Users should generally prefer to leave this config unset and instead use delivery.timeout.ms to control retry behavior.

Enabling idempotence requires this config value to be greater than 0. If conflicting configurations are set and idempotence is not explicitly enabled, idempotence is disabled.

Allowing retries while setting enable.idempotence to false and max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to greater than 1 will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first.

Type:	int
Default:	2147483647
Valid Values:	[0,...,2147483647]
Importance:	high

### batch.size
The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes.

No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size.

Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent.

A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely). A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records.

Note: This setting gives the upper bound of the batch size to be sent. If we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition, we will 'linger' for the linger.ms time waiting for more records to show up. This linger.ms setting defaults to 0, which means we'll immediately send out a record even the accumulated batch size is under this batch.size setting.

Type:	int
Default:	16384
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	medium


### client.id
An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging.

Type:	string
Default:	""
Valid Values:	
Importance:	medium


### delivery.timeout.ms
An upper bound on the time to report success or failure after a call to send() returns. This limits the total time that a record will be delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgement from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retriable send failures. The producer may report failure to send a record earlier than this config if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch which reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this config should be greater than or equal to the sum of request.timeout.ms and linger.ms.

Type:	int
Default:	120000 (2 minutes)
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	medium


### linger.ms
The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delayâ€”that is, rather than immediately sending out a record, the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get batch.size worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay). Setting linger.ms=5, for example, would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load.

Type:	long
Default:	0
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	medium


### max.block.ms
The configuration controls how long the KafkaProducer's send(), partitionsFor(), initTransactions(), sendOffsetsToTransaction(), commitTransaction() and abortTransaction() methods will block. For send() this timeout bounds the total time waiting for both metadata fetch and buffer allocation (blocking in the user-supplied serializers or partitioner is not counted against this timeout). For partitionsFor() this timeout bounds the time spent waiting for metadata if it is unavailable. The transaction-related methods always block, but may timeout if the transaction coordinator could not be discovered or did not respond within the timeout.

Type:	long
Default:	60000 (1 minute)
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	medium


### max.request.size
The maximum size of a request in bytes. This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum uncompressed record batch size. Note that the server has its own cap on the record batch size (after compression if compression is enabled) which may be different from this.

Type:	int
Default:	1048576
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	medium


### request.timeout.ms
The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted. This should be larger than replica.lag.time.max.ms (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries.

Type:	int
Default:	30000 (30 seconds)
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	medium



### acks
The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:

acks=0 If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the retries configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.
acks=1 This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.
acks=all This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. This is equivalent to the acks=-1 setting.
Note that enabling idempotence requires this config value to be 'all'. If conflicting configurations are set and idempotence is not explicitly enabled, idempotence is disabled.

Type:	string
Default:	all
Valid Values:	[all, -1, 0, 1]
Importance:	low


### enable.idempotence
When set to 'true', the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If 'false', producer retries due to broker failures, etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Note that enabling idempotence requires max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to be less than or equal to 5 (with message ordering preserved for any allowable value), retries to be greater than 0, and acks must be 'all'.

Idempotence is enabled by default if no conflicting configurations are set. If conflicting configurations are set and idempotence is not explicitly enabled, idempotence is disabled. If idempotence is explicitly enabled and conflicting configurations are set, a ConfigException is thrown.

Type:	boolean
Default:	true
Valid Values:	
Importance:	low



### interceptor.classes
A list of classes to use as interceptors. Implementing the org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerInterceptor interface allows you to intercept (and possibly mutate) the records received by the producer before they are published to the Kafka cluster. By default, there are no interceptors.

Type:	list
Default:	""
Valid Values:	non-null string
Importance:	low


### max.in.flight.requests.per.connection
The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking. Note that if this configuration is set to be greater than 1 and enable.idempotence is set to false, there is a risk of message reordering after a failed send due to retries (i.e., if retries are enabled); if retries are disabled or if enable.idempotence is set to true, ordering will be preserved. Additionally, enabling idempotence requires the value of this configuration to be less than or equal to 5. If conflicting configurations are set and idempotence is not explicitly enabled, idempotence is disabled.

Type:	int
Default:	5
Valid Values:	[1,...]
Importance:	low


### retry.backoff.max.ms
The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait when retrying a request to the broker that has repeatedly failed. If provided, the backoff per client will increase exponentially for each failed request, up to this maximum. To prevent all clients from being synchronized upon retry, a randomized jitter with a factor of 0.2 will be applied to the backoff, resulting in the backoff falling within a range between 20% below and 20% above the computed value. If retry.backoff.ms is set to be higher than retry.backoff.max.ms, then retry.backoff.max.ms will be used as a constant backoff from the beginning without any exponential increase

Type:	long
Default:	1000 (1 second)
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	low


### retry.backoff.ms
The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios. This value is the initial backoff value and will increase exponentially for each failed request, up to the retry.backoff.max.ms value.

Type:	long
Default:	100
Valid Values:	[0,...]
Importance:	low
